# Community Detection in Academic Citation Networks

## Overview
This project investigates the role of community detection in analyzing academic citation networks, particularly within computer science literature. Using the DBLP dataset, this research applies advanced algorithms to identify thematic clusters and collaboration patterns among scholarly documents and authors. The findings provide insights into influential works, collaborative relationships, and emerging trends in computer science research.

## Abstract
This study explores community detection in academic citation networks, emphasizing its utility in understanding extensive literature bodies. By analyzing the DBLP dataset, we utilize algorithms like the Louvain method and the Girvan-Newman algorithm to reveal structured communities within citation networks. This approach helps in identifying pivotal research works, tracking collaborations, and uncovering meaningful insights. Our findings demonstrate the potential of community detection to advance knowledge in computer science through effective literature navigation and trend analysis.
